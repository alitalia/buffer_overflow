Remeber to put exe and dll in the same folder. <br>
By default the daemon start on port 666 but you can personilze the port by the command ```evilserv.exe <port>```<br>
The server contain two function ```SUPERSECUREFUNC``` used in the talk for the practice part and ```SUPERSECUREFUNC2``` that need a 
higher level of knowledge to be exploited.
